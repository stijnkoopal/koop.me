      I&apos;ve always had a profound interest for computers and math; be it games, programming,
      messing around or just searching the great internet.
      While gaming eventually went away, the rest was there to stay.
      Computer technology excite me, especially things related to the web.

      After finishing my master in computer science, things started to get less theoretical real fast.
      I started out as technical engineer in the Java stack.
      Currently, I have experience in both front- and backend;
      there aren&apos;t a whole lot of languages/platforms/paradigms that I didn&apos;t touch.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time I tend to be outside a lot, especially exercising.
      Also playing around with my kid and drinking beer with friends is high on the agenda.
